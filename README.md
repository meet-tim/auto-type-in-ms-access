# Auto-type in ms access with python
laziness brings out the best ideas lol
Probably you feel lazy to manually type data into ms access, I gottcha..

This piece of code autotypes provided data into ms access from top to down.

library used:pyautogui

#### Preconditions
1. 1.Make sure no program or pop up message interferes when the code is running. This will disrupt  
the process. In case you get into this situation, drag your mouse to the left most corner on your screen to stop the code.

1. 2.The code starts typing after 5 seconds. This is to ensure that the mouse is in position before the typing begins.

1. 3.Provided data should be in a horizontal manner with no spaces.
##### Example:
* James
* Tim
* Jessica
* Mike

### How to use
1. 0.Open ms access
1. 1.add the file name to the code
1. 2.make sure file is in the same folder as the code
1. 3.Run the code
1. 4.Place the mouse pointer on the cell where you want the auto typing to begin at.
Wait for 5 seconds and it begins(5 seconds to ensure the mouse is at the starting point.)
